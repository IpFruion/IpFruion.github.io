I have completed all the required course work for the program as well as published research in <a href=\"https://www.ece.iastate.edu/kcsl/icse-2019-mockingbird/\">ICSE 2019.</a></p>\n        <p>From an early age, I have always had a passion for programming and problem solving. I started my programming adventure as a freshman at high school, in the FIRST robotics program on the High School Robotics Team. I learned about programming, enough to become the leader of the programming team, teaching others about programming. In the end, my strategy for getting programmers to work productively with one another, worked to improve my collaborative ability.</p>\n      </Section>\n      <Section name=\"Background\">\n        <p>During my Master's program I focused my course work into machine learning and artificial intelligence. My research focused on dynamic program analysis to study how to find vulnerabilities in programs.</p>\n        <p>In my free time, I create my own personal projects that I aim to help others in all aspects of life. I am an avid gamer that enjoys pairing my gameplay with programming. Recently, I developed a <a href=\"https://github.com/IpFruion/PokIdex\">web application</a> that helps users keep track of their pokemon card's values over time. </p>\n        <p>Iowa State University taught me different ways to go about designing a programming solution. The Agile Development Process design and development skills because it had a produce, review, and revise cycle. ISU has given me the opportunity to look in depth as to how people understand computer science viewpoint and how to apply this major the application of software to real world problems. At ISU, we programmed in teams as well as individually to provide real world experiences. We also used modern tools that businesses use to develop software. This provided us with an understanding of the current languages used by companies. I also learned ethical responsibilities as a software engineer and what we need to be aware of in business.</p>\n        <p>ISU helped me to develop my passion and motivate me to advance my education into graduate school. To complete my schoolwork, I networked with friends and students outside of ISU, in a very collaborative environment. In addition, I have continued research to understand the nuances of programming languages outside the classroom.</p>\n        <p>Software engineering is my passion and opportunities to ideas to apply programming to my everyday life occur to me, all the time.I continue to reach for new goals in what I am developing and with new understandings. I create my own personal projects when I have free time. I continue to stay on top of the latest technologies and how they affect me and how I can be apart of them. I seek out and search for answers to programming questions. I find cool new things that I can use immediately or in the future.</p>\n      </Section>\n      <Section name=\"Experience\" childIsRow={true}>\n        <Col lg={4}>\n          <h5>Work</h5>\n          <p>2018-2019 Research Assistant for a Darpa funded college program called <a href=\"https://www.darpa.mil/program/space-time-analysis-for-cybersecurity\">STAC</a>.</p>\n          <p>2017 Software Developer Intern for Leidos, Corp. I worked on a project that allows private pilots to submit flight plans and flight briefs. It was written in Java and progressed my understanding of the agile development process with everyday meetings called standups and with issue planning events. I gave a presentation at the end of my internship about my progress of the project I worked on.</p>\n          <p>2016 Software Development Intern at National Information Solutions Coop (NISC).

I worked on creating a targeted dynamic analysis tool that I called Mockingbird for my education research. This tool is used to help detect vulnerabilities using random input on a target function or area of code inside an application to detect time or space vulnerabilities. The tool is written in Java but the concept for targeted dynamic analysis can be used in most languages.</p>\n          <p>2018 Senior Design Project. The project’s goal was to help the general public find parking spots on ISU campus. This project attempts to solve the overcrowding of parking lots and the reduce the use of individual vehicles to determine which parking lot to go to by keeping track of the cars that are in the parking lot and relaying this information to the public. My role was Team lead, to ensure team members understood and accomplished their work on time. I also did all the code reviews and made sure that the committed code is functioning without errors. I managed the repository actions. I contributed to the post-processing machine by helping to create the machine-learning model and created the data collection for the model's training.</p>\n          <p>2012-2014 Robotics. I participated in the after school program FIRST robotics on the programming team. We created a full development application to drive and manipulate a robots features including solenoids, motors, and sensors. The objective of the program was to develop a robot to solve problems each year. I lead the programming team for two of the four years that I was on the team.</p>\n        </Col>\n        <Col lg={4}>\n          <h5>Personal</h5>\n          <p>2021 Rust.

Pokemon Card index that gets you how much your cards are worth and tracks overtime how much your card portfolio. I used this project to familiarize myself with React development and some web development paradigms. You can create a portfolio and add cards to it by specifying the card id. A planned future update is to add the ability to scan a card to gather the card name and id.</p>\n          <p>2020 CC: Tweaked Lua. The game Minecraft is my favorite video game. Using the mod CC: Tweaked, you can create these computers that run off of a Lua OS. I enjoy creating programs that do different actions inside the game such as creating a robot that moves to locations inside the 3D world. This is done by using several vector transformations to achieve the desired movement.</p>\n        </Col>\n      </Section>\n      <Section name=\"Languages and Development Tools\">\n        {getSkills({\n          \"Java\": 3,\n          \"Python\": 3,\n          \"C/C++\": 1,\n          \"Agile and Scrum Process\": 2,\n          \"Web Design and Development\": 1,\n          \"Mobile application development iOS and Android\": 2,\n          \"Database\": 2,\n          \"Git Source Control Process\": 2,\n          \"Experience in Machine Learning\": 1,\n        })}\n        <div class=\"mt-4 mb-3\">\n          <h5>Integrated Development Environments</h5>\n        </div>\n        <p>For most of my development career I have used the <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/\">Jetbrains</a> toolsuite such as <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/\">Intellij</a> (for Java) and <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/\">Pycharm</a> (for Python). Jetbrains seems to provide fantastic IDE tools to help develpers create fantastic code.</p>\n        <p>When Jetbrains doesn't offer a community version for a programming language (or doesn't support a specific programming language) I use the <a href=\"https://atom.io/\">Atom editor</a>. It provides a modular text editor that has modern programming features like autocomplete, syntax highlighting, as well as version control built into it. It also provides a set of packages that developers can install to help them code such as a console directly in the editor window.</p>\n        <p>For my source control I have used Git since back in Highschool with robotics as my main source control. In my Job experience I have used SVN when working with Leidos and I used Atlassian products (along with Git source control) when working with NISC. This allowed me to learn many source control practices such as branching, comitting, pull requests and merging.</p>\n      </Section>\n      <Section name=\"Reflections\">\n        <p>During my academic years and working as an intern, I was able to build upon the passion of Software Engineering. Below are some of the things I learned.</p>\n        <p>In High School, I quickly found that I had a passion for programming and problem solving. Iowa State University (ISU) encouraged development of this passion and drove me to apply for Graduate School. I learned several ways to go about designing programming solutions. In addition, ISU gave me the opportunity to explore, in depth, how people understand the Computer Science viewpoint and how to apply Software Engineering to real world problems.</p>\n        <p>During my internships, and with class projects, I learned to work in a team environment and even to lead a small team of developers. In addition, I collaborated with friends and other students outside the classroom, on many projects. My Graduate research work allowed me to collaborate with experts in the Computer Science industry. I have used several research sources to expand my skills as a Software Developer.</p>\n        <p>The languages and tools used during my internship and class projects have provided me with real world experience in several areas. I used the Agile method because it enhanced collaboration and feedback communication with short produce, review, and revise cycles. I have also learned the ethical responsibilities of being a Software Engineer and what Engineers need to be aware of in business.</p>\n        <p>In my free time, I create my own personal programming projects. I continue to stay on top of emerging technologies, how they impact people and how I can participate in their emergence. I seek out answers to programming questions when I run into problems. Sometimes the answers lead me to find cool new programming methods/tips that I implement in future code.</p>\n      </Section>\n      <Qoute name =\"Alan Turing\" qoute=\"We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done.\"/>\n    </Container>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Project(props) {\n  return (\n    <Row className=\"m-3 mb-4\">\n      <Col md={{span: 9, offset: 1}}>\n        <Row>\n          <h4>{props.name}</h4>\n        </Row>\n        {props.children && (\n          <Row>\n            {props.children}\n          </Row>\n        )}\n        <Row>\n          <a class=\"downloadButton\" href={props.link}>{props.linkButtonName}</a>\n        </Row>\n      </Col>\n    </Row>\n  );\n}\n\n\nexport function Projects() {\n  return (\n    <Container fluid>\n      <Row className=\"pt-4\">\n        <Col md={{offset: 1}}>\n          These are examples of my software development.
