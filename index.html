                <h4>Introduction / Career Path</h4>
                <p>Hello my name is Derrick Lockwood. I am currently a student at Iowa State University.</p>
                <p>I have been a software developer for 5 years. I started my programming adventure in kshell and bash.
                    Then in freshman year at my high school, I saw a cocurricular activity called FIRST robotics.
                    I then proceeded to join the Eagan Robotics Team. Our team name is Blue Twilight and our team number is
                    2220. The first year I joined Eagan Robotics I knew I wanted to go into the programming sub-team to program the
                    software that is on the robot. The first year in robotics was a difficult one. I was just getting used to
                    the high school environment and none of the programming leads "taught" me how Java (one of the programming languages
                    FIRST uses as software on the robot) works and what functionality it had on the robot. The first year I was partnered
                    with a Senor and we worked on a mini deployable robot from the main one. I can say with all honesty that I didn't learn
                    much my freshman year in robotics but it was fun to got to the competitions. :)
                </p>
                <p>
                    My Sophomore year was much better, I learned Java (object orientated programming language) and practiced it all that year even when the robotics season ended.
                    Being in robotics that year was also difficult because I wanted to take a class called AP Computer Science. This class
                    taught students a basic level of programming but more importantly how good coding and designing works. Though to take
                    this class you needed to have taken algebra two which I had not my Sophomore year, so I doubled up on math and took geometry
                    and algebra two in the same year. What a pain... When I finally reached AP Computer Science I was prepared to ace this
                    class. In this class having that extra experience with Java helped me to always be a couple of steps ahead of the class.
                    I usually know how each project worked and each concept worked before the units start. Though I can't say I didn't learn
                    anything because actually I learned quite a bit. I learned how to design the answer to the problem before coding it,
                    I learned some cool "tricks of the trade" with Java. All in all I think that class excelled my compassion for software
                    development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My Junior year was one of my favorite in terms of software development. I was in my 3rd year of robotics and I became
                    a programming sub-team lead. It was fun and educating to lead a group of students towards a goal of building software
                    for that year's robot. I think that in that year I learned even more quarks of programming in Java and how to structure
                    group coding. A challenge that was brought to me that year was getting kids who didn't know how to program in Java to
                    join in and learn. I think that the way we did it that year didn't work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I then come to my final year in robotics, my Senior year. It was a blast to work with all the great students at Eagan High School.
                    I grew into a leader of a programming team. In the end my strategy for getting programmers to work conducively with one another
                    worked out. It built me up as a leader and I continue to work on better ways to improve my collaborative ability.
                </p>
